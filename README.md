<h1>Tic Tac Toe Game in Python</h1>
This is a simple implementation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell. The first player to place three of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
To run the game, simply execute the tictactoe.py file in your Python environment. The game will prompt you to enter the names of the two players.

The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full, resulting in a tie.

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
The game is implemented in Python 3, using basic data structures and control flow statements. The board is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the board.
